### Some things to consider as a plan:

1. Polling for Price Updates:
   Set up your Lambda function to trigger at regular intervals, such as every few minutes or seconds, depending on your trading strategy's requirements and the frequency of market data updates.
   Within the Lambda function, retrieve the latest market data from your chosen source (e.g., a financial API) using HTTP requests or SDKs provided by the data provider.
   Parse the response to extract relevant information, such as the current price of the asset you're trading.

2. Evaluation of Trading Conditions:
   Implement logic within the Lambda function to evaluate the current market conditions against your predefined trading strategy.
   Check if the current price of the asset meets the conditions for initiating a buy or sell order based on your chosen technical indicators and strategy rules. For example, if the current price crosses above a moving average, it might trigger a buy signal, while crossing below could trigger a sell signal.

3. Order Placement:
   If the trading conditions are met, use the appropriate broker API or trading platform SDK to place the buy or sell order programmatically.
   Ensure that you specify the correct order type (e.g., market, limit) and quantity based on your strategy and available funds.

4. Error Handling and Retry Mechanism:
   Implement error handling within the Lambda function to handle any failures that may occur during the process of retrieving market data or placing orders.
   Set up a retry mechanism to reattempt failed API requests or order placements, with backoff and exponential delay strategies to avoid hitting rate limits or overwhelming the broker's API.

5. Logging and Monitoring:
   Log relevant information, such as executed trades, order statuses, and any errors encountered, to a centralized logging service like Amazon CloudWatch.
   Set up monitoring alerts to notify you of any issues or anomalies in the trading bot's behavior, such as failed order placements or unexpected errors.

### Yarn workspaces (POA)

1. Root Workspace:
   Create a root directory for your project, where you'll initialize Yarn workspaces.
   This directory will contain configuration files and scripts shared across all packages.

2. Lambda Function Package:
   Create a package specifically for your Lambda function that implements the trading bot logic.
   This package will contain the Lambda function code, dependencies, and configuration files.

3. Market Data Service Package:
   Create a separate package for the service responsible for polling market data updates.
   This package will handle fetching real-time market data from external APIs and providing it to the Lambda function.

4. Trading Strategy Package:
   Create a package to define and manage your trading strategies and technical indicators.
   This package can contain reusable modules or classes representing different trading strategies, as well as utilities for evaluating market conditions.

5. Broker API Integration Package:
   Create a package to handle integration with the broker's API or trading platform SDK.
   This package will provide functions for placing buy and sell orders, managing positions, and handling authentication with the broker's API.

6. Common Utilities Package:
   Create a package to store common utility functions or modules used across multiple parts of the project.
   This package can include helper functions for logging, error handling, data parsing, and other shared functionalities.

7. Configuration Package:
   Create a package to store configuration files and environment variables used by the Lambda function and other components.
   This package will centralize configuration settings such as API keys, trading parameters, and logging options.

8. Testing Package (Optional):
   Create a package dedicated to writing and running tests for your trading bot.
   This package will contain test scripts, fixtures, and mock data for verifying the functionality of your code.

### Potentially APIs

For testing purposes, there are several APIs and simulated trading platforms available that you can use to fetch market data and simulate trading without making actual transactions. Here are a few options:

Alpha Vantage:

- Alpha Vantage provides free APIs for fetching real-time and historical market data for stocks, forex, and cryptocurrencies. They offer endpoints for retrieving stock prices, technical indicators, and fundamental data.
  Website: Alpha Vantage

Polygon.io:

- Polygon.io offers APIs for real-time and historical market data, including stock prices, volume, and bid/ask quotes. They also provide access to crypto market data and news feeds.
  Website: Polygon.io

IEX Cloud:

- IEX Cloud provides APIs for accessing real-time and historical stock market data, including quotes, trades, and company fundamentals. They offer both free and paid tiers with various data access levels.
  Website: IEX Cloud

Alpaca:

- Alpaca offers a commission-free stock trading API that allows you to execute paper trades in a simulated environment. You can use their API to submit orders, manage positions, and track account balances without risking real money.
  Website: Alpaca

Backtrader:

- Backtrader is a popular Python library for backtesting trading strategies using historical market data. It provides a framework for developing and testing custom trading algorithms using historical data from various sources.

### Trading strategies

As for trading strategies, you can start with some basic strategies and gradually explore more advanced ones as you gain experience. Here are a few simple trading strategies to consider for testing your skills:

Moving Average Crossover:

- Buy when a short-term moving average (e.g., 50-day) crosses above a longer-term moving average (e.g., 200-day), and sell when the opposite occurs.

RSI (Relative Strength Index) Strategy:

- Buy when the RSI indicator is oversold (below a certain threshold, e.g., 30) and sell when it is overbought (above a certain threshold, e.g., 70).

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) Strategy:

- Buy when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell when it crosses below.

Bollinger Bands Strategy:



- Buy when the price touches the lower Bollinger Band and sell when it touches the upper Bollinger Band.
